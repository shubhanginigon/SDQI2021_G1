##  **_AIR QUALITY(PM2.5) MONITORING SYSTEM_**

*In this contemporary environment air pollution or air quality have become a big concern as the quality is degrading exponentially. One of which is the PM2.5 crisis where the size of particles is directly linked to their potential for causing health problems. Fine particles (PM2.5) pose the greatest health risk. These fine particles can get deep into lungs and some may even get into the bloodstream. Exposure to these particles can affect a person's lungs and heart.*

*Our motive for this project is to **analyze the air quality data from the sensor** and give a clear vision in a way of dashboard. Therefore, we are going to d**evelop the web app which will show all the required details** related to air quality and accordingly people can take preventive measures.
This web application will be **using Hadoop and Apache Kylin as a backend to hold a huge amount of  data from sensors** and they will be processed with BI tools and different important insights are visualized using an interactive dashboard. As of now, we will be starting with Java Spring Boot framework for developing the system.*
